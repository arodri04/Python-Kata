# Python-Kata
This is a start to me doing python katas, I'll save them here.

1: Will you make it?

Description:You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.
Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.
Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

2: Bit Counting(binaryconvert)

Description: Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative. Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

3: Interactive Dictionary

Description: In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries.

4: Sum of Digits

Description: Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

5:Descending Order

Description: Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

6: Find the odd int

URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da5a58ea159efa38000836/solutions/python

Description: Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

7: Morse Code

Description: In this kata you have to write a simple Morse code decoder. While the Morse code is now mostly superseded by voice and digital data communication channels, it still has its use in some applications around the world.
The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes". For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words. For example, the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−−   ·−−− ··− −·· ·.

NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.

In addition to letters, digits and some punctuation, there are some special service codes, the most notorious of those is the international distress signal SOS (that was first issued by Titanic), that is coded as ···−−−···. These special codes are treated as single special characters, and usually are transmitted as separate words.

Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.
